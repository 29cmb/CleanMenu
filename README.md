### Main Menu

The main menu has some tweaks that make it look a bit cleaner, such as by positioning the social icons below the set of large buttons. Along with this, you can optionally hide the robtop logo and the more games button. Finally, the profile button has been moved to the bottom right corner with the name along the bottom.

### Creator Menu

All the un-necessary buttons have been removed and all the other ones have been split into two groups, focused and unfocused. Focused buttons are the create, saved, lists, and search buttons, and the unfocused ones are everyhing else. The focused buttons are displayed at the top with larger scaling, while the unfocused buttons are beneath them with small scaling.

### Search Menu

### Profile Menu
